## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience with CSS positioning and layering techniques. Specifically, I learned how to:

- Create and position background shapes using CSS pseudo-elements and absolute positioning
- Effectively use the `z-index` property to control the stacking order of elements
- Implement complex background designs that enhance the visual appeal without interfering with content readability
- Better understand how the `position` property (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`) affects element placement and creates new stacking contexts

These techniques allowed me to achieve the desired visual design while maintaining clean, semantic HTML structure.
